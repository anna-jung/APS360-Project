owl is hooting at windy night
cat starts to meow and owl keeps hooting in the distance
the cat continues meowing while being chased by the hooting owl in the bushes

dog is barking loudly in the park
children laughing and playing nearby
the dog runs around while children continue their joyful games

rain is falling gently on leaves
thunder rumbles in the distance
the storm intensifies with heavy rainfall and lightning
