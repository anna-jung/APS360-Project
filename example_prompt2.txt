birds chirping in the morning
gentle wind rustling through trees
peaceful forest sounds with distant bird calls

car engine starting up
tires screeching on pavement
the vehicle drives away into traffic noise

ocean waves crashing on shore
seagulls crying overhead
the tide comes in with powerful wave sounds
